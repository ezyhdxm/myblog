### `README.md`

Hi! I’m Hao Yan, a 4th-year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I specialize in solving mathematical mysteries—mostly at 4 AM, because that’s when all the hallucinations happen. I am also a living, breathing example of an induction head, because I love repeating myself. I love repeating myself. And I want to understand why. Why? 

I love drinking coffee and taking stochastic toilet breaks, and repeating myself. My favorite place to practice presentations is the shower. The audience of shampoo bottles is the best --- they are interested in all kinds of topics, never ask hard questions and always invite me to sing my favorite songs.

If, for some reason, you feel the urge to escape, the portal to my personal website is [here](https://ezyhdxm.github.io). But honestly, there’s probably nothing worth reading --- unless you enjoy existential dread in HTML. Perhaps open your browser’s inspect tool and read the console logs? Who knows, I might have left a secret message there.
